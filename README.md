# Semantic Version

For the complete spec visit https://semver.org. The information below is extracted from that page for reference within this project

## Introduction

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
1. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
1. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
